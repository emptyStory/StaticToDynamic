# StaticToDynamic
 This tool is intended for use in situations where the player has the opportunity to craft a game object from its component parts. To display the possibility of creating a game object, a special shader is used, which is not affected by lighting, and therefore should not be baked. But after creating a game object, it is replaced with an identical object with a shader that is affected by lighting, and which must be pre-baked.
